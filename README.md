Canons
======

July's entry into the 1 Game Per Month Challenge.

A simple fire cannonballs at the opponent game.

There is no AI, this is a "Share the controller" style game.

There is no sound. I got distracted by Borderlands and ran out of time.


Controls
========
Player 1 and Player 2 are both controlled by the first controller.
This is due to the fact that almost everyone will play this game in an emulator.

 * **D-Pad:** increment/decrement value
 * **B:** Select
 * **A:** Cancel


License
=======
This game is released under the MIT license.
